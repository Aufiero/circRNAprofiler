  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in key cellular processes, including RNA transport, splicing, polyadenylation and stability. Understanding the interaction between RBPs and RNA is key to improve our knowledge of RNA processing, localization and regulation in a global manner. Despite advances in recent years, a unified non-redundant resource that includes information on experimentally validated motifs, RBPs and integrated tools to exploit this information is lacking. Here, we developed a database named ATtRACT (available athttp://attract.cnic.es) that compiles information on 370 RBPs and 1583 RBP consensus binding motifs, 192 of which are not present in any other database. To populate ATtRACT we (i) extracted and hand-curated experimentally validated data from CISBP-RNA, SpliceAid-F, RBPDB databases, (ii) integrated and updated the unavailable ASD database and (iii) extracted information from Protein-RNA complexes present in Protein Data Bank database through computational analyses. ATtRACT provides also efficient algorithms to search a specific motif and scan one or more RNA sequences at a time. It also allows discoveringde novomotifs enriched in a set of related sequences and compare them with the motifs included in the database.Database URL:http://~attract.~cnic.~es.},

These developments have improved the data release frequency by increasing automation of curation and providing scaling improvements. The range of available Catalog data has also been extended with structured ancestry and recruitment information added for all studies. The infrastructure improvements also support scaling for larger arrays, exome and sequencing studies, allowing the Catalog to adapt to the needs of evolving study design, genotyping technologies and user needs in the future.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) is essential for normal splicing of many cardiac genes, and loss of RBM20 causes dilated cardiomyopathy. Given its role in splicing, we hypothesized an important role for RBM20 in forming circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of noncoding RNA molecules.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of RBM20 in the formation of circRNAs in the heart.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we performed circRNA profiling on ribosomal depleted RNA from human hearts and identified the expression of thousands of circRNAs, with some of them regulated in disease. Interestingly, we identified 80 circRNAs to be expressed from the titin gene, a gene that is known to undergo highly complex alternative splicing. We show that some of these circRNAs are dynamically regulated in dilated cardiomyopathy but not in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We generated RBM20-null mice and show that they completely lack these titin circRNAs. In addition, in a cardiac sample from an RBM20 mutation carrier, titin circRNA production was severely altered. Interestingly, the loss of RBM20 caused only a specific subset of titin circRNAs to be lost. These circRNAs originated from the RBM20-regulated I-band region of the titin transcript.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that RBM20 is crucial for the formation of a subset of circRNAs that originate from the I-band of the titin gene. We propose that RBM20, by excluding specific exons from the pre-mRNA, provides the substrate to form this class of RBM20-dependent circRNAs.},

  abstract = {Background
RNA-Seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome profiling. One aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify the expression levels of genomic elements, such as genes, their transcripts and exons. Acquiring a transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. Multiple human genome annotation databases exist, including RefGene (RefSeq Gene), Ensembl, and the UCSC annotation database. The impact of the choice of an annotation on estimating gene expression remains insufficiently investigated.

Results
In this paper, we systematically characterized the impact of genome annotation choice on read mapping and transcriptome quantification by analyzing a RNA-Seq dataset generated by the Human Body Map 2.0 Project. The impact of a gene model on mapping of non-junction reads is different from junction reads. For the RNA-Seq dataset with a read length of 75~bp, on average, 95\% of non-junction reads were mapped to exactly the same genomic location regardless of which gene models was used. By contrast, this percentage dropped to 53\% for junction reads. In addition, about 30\% of junction reads failed to align without the assistance of a gene model, while 10\textendash{}15\% mapped alternatively. There are 21,958 common genes among RefGene, Ensembl, and UCSC annotations. When we compared the gene quantification results in RefGene and Ensembl annotations, 20\% of genes are not expressed, and thus have a zero count in both annotations. Surprisingly, identical gene quantification results were obtained for only 16.3\% (about one sixth) of genes. Approximately 28.1\% of genes' expression levels differed by 5\% or higher, and of those, the relative expression levels for 9.3\% of genes (equivalent to 2038) differed by 50\% or greater. The case studies revealed that the gene definition differences in gene models frequently result in inconsistency in gene quantification.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that the choice of a gene model has a dramatic effect on both gene quantification and differential analysis. Our research will help RNA-Seq data analysts to make an informed choice of gene model in practical RNA-Seq data analysis.
